# The following dance with `file mtime ...` is used to advise Vivado that

#   https://www.xilinx.com/support/answers/51418.html
# The trick is simply to restore the version file's timestamp so Vivado doesn't
# think it has changed.  Synthesis is going rebuild *everything* anyway, so this
# really doesn't matter.
