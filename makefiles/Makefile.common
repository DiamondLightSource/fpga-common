# Passing makefile exports through is a bit tiresome.  We could mark our
# symbols with export -- but that means *every* command gets them, and I
# don't like that.  This macro instead just exports the listed symbols into a
# called function, designed to be called like:
#
#       $(call EXPORT,$(EXPORTS)) script
#

# Sometimes we allow a parameter to be specified either as a name which we
# look up in a predefined directory, or as a fixed path.  This macro
# encapsulates this, designed to be called thus:
#
#   $(call COMPUTE_PATH,param_name,path_name,default_dir)
#
# Here param_name is the name of the parameter that may be updated, path_name
# will be updated with the full path to the identifed component, and
# default_dir is the default base directory.
#
# This supports three ways of defining param_name:
#
#   1. param_name=name
#       In this case path_name is set to default_dir/name.  This is the
#       normal case when a default configuration can be used.
#   2. param_name=/path/to/name
#       In this case path_name is set to /path/to/name and param_name is
#       forced to name.  This is the case when an external configuration is
#       used.
